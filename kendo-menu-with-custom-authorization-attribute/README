### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The code library shows how to use Menu widget to navigate to different views. Menu show/hides menu items depending on the user authentication.

In the project three custom authorize attributes are used:

1. **AllowAnonymousAttribute** - allows the decorated Action method to all users
2. **GroupAuthorizeAttribute** - verifies whether the logged in user is allowed to see this view. This attribute extends default behavior of AuthorizeAttribute and allows to define multiple roles
3. **CustomUnauthorizedActionResult** - this attribute should be used when you want to hide menu item and still navigate to a normal view, which gives some information to the unauthorized users.

The project also shows how to use Menu widget to navigate to different areas.
